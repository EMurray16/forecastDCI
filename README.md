# forecastDCI

After making three entirely different repositories for three years, this repository is now the long-lasting repository for the DCI model. 

New branches will be created for either (1) active development, or (2) as static images of the model for a given season. 

This branch is for creating historic backcasts for all years in which there are data. Eventually this will become it's own freestanding app, separate of the main yearly DCI forecasts.
